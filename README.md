# Clarity AI API Utils

## What is this repo?
Here you may find some tools, helpers, code snippets or examples that will help you with the most common tasks required to 
develop code that consumes the services offered by Clarity AI through our HTTP REST API.

Our intention is to share with the developers using our API a way to make their integration with our services easier, so 
they can create code that consume our sustainability data as smoothly as possible.

## How to use it
This is not a lib of reusable components that you can import directly in your project using a package manager (for instance 
importing them from Maven, npm or any other artifact repository)

Instead, this is more like a collection of reusable code that you should be able of copy/paste directly without any 
modification into your own code and start using it, in order to facilitate common work that needs to be done when using
our API. It should be generic and simple enough to fit in most of the use cases.

Every functionality should have their own Unit Tests that you can check to see an example of how to use the code after
you integrated it in your functionality.

You will find implementations for the most common programming languages out there

## Contribute
The idea of this repo is also to be open to all developers to contribute, so if you see anything
that you think can be improved or do you have some code that you think that can be useful for other fellow 
developers, please don't hesitate to make your PR, so we can take a look and eventually merge it here.
