# Clarity AI API Samples

## What is this repo?
Here you may find some helpers and code snippets that will help you while 
developing code that consumes the REST services offered by Clarity AI through our (Public API)[https://developer.clarity.ai/].

Our intention is to share this code with all developers out there that need to make an integration with our services, so 
they can easily and smoothly create applications that consume our sustainability data.

## How to use it
This is not intended to be a lib or an SDK that you can add as a dependency in your project using a package manager (for instance 
importing them from Maven, pip, npm or any other artifact repository)

Instead, look at these samples more like a collection of reusable code that you can copy/paste directly  
into your own code and start using it right away. It's designed to facilitate the common work that is required to be done when using our API. 
It should be generic and simple enough to fit most of the use cases.

Every functionality should have their own Unit Tests or at least code that shows how they work in practice, 
as starting point when adding it in your own application.

You will find implementations for some of the most common programming languages out there

## Contribute
The idea of this repo is also to be open to all developers to contribute, so if you see anything
that you think can be improved or do you have some code that you think that can be useful for other fellow 
developers, please don't hesitate to make your PR, so we can take a look and eventually merge it here.
